## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gray (#808080) for a modern, neutral background. The choice of a desaturated color expresses neutrality.
- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3). As the app uses a light scheme, the background should be of similar hue to the primary, but a lighter shade.
- Accent color: Dark blue (#00008B) to highlight key actions. Blue lies close to gray in the color space, and thus fulfills the request for compact, abstract coloring. But using dark blue, good contrast is achieved so it will stand out in the light layout.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text and headers; a modern, machined look complements the functionality of tracking processes.
- Abstract, flat-style icons for navigation and counters to maintain a minimal design aesthetic.
- Compact UI with less padding and small icons for a clean, efficient interface.
- GSAP animations for page transitions and dashboard element reveals, including slide-in sidebar and fade/scale-in dashboard cards.
